# Charlottesville Parking Ticket Hotspots Case Study

## Repository Overview
Welcome to the Charlottesville Parking Ticket Hotspots Case Study repository! In this project, you’ll use Python to analyze real parking ticket data and identify which areas of Charlottesville experience the most frequent violations. All materials required to complete the case study are included here, and the analysis will be conducted using Jupyter Notebook to explore the dataset and visualize results.

## Hook Document
The [Parking Ticket Case Study Hook Document](https://github.com/jpmeyer1/CS3-Parking-Tickets/blob/main/Hook%20Document.pdf) introduces you to this case and what your role will be when going through the study.

## Rubric

## Data
**Instructions to access data:**
1. Go to [Charlotteville's Open Data Portal](https://opendata.charlottesville.org/)
2. Search for "Parking Tickets"
3. Select the "Parking Tickets" dataset, "Download," and select the option to download the CSV file

## Scripts

1. Navigate to [SCRIPTS folder](https://github.com/jpmeyer1/CS3-Parking-Tickets/tree/main/SCRIPTS)
2. Open both .ipynb script files
3. In each file, replace the file path and run code to generate output

## Supplemental Material
Contains extra documents to help contextualize both the motivation for this project, as well as some of the technical aspects involved in this project. [Minneapolis Parking Tickets](CS3-Parking-Tickets/Supplemental%Materials/Minneapolis%Parking%Tickets.pdf) describes a data study done on parking tickets in Minneapolis, Austin, and Portland, similar to the work you'll do in this project. [Python Heatmap](CS3-Parking-Tickets/Supplemental%Materials/Python%Heatmap.pdf) describes best practices and techniques for building a heatmap in Python, similar to the one you'll create in this project. [Charlottesville Parking Study](CS3-Parking-Tickets/Supplemental%Materials/Charlottesville%Parking%Study.pdf) is a study of parking in Charlottesville completed by the city in 2015, and [NYC Parking Tickets Visualization](CS3-Parking-Tickets/Supplemental%Materials/NYC%Parking%Tickets%Visualization.pdf) contains a data project that is closely aligned with this case study.
